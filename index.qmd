This is the landing page for practical exercises related to the topic **survey measurement error**, from the Utrecht University summer course *S16: survey research*.

The slides can be found here: <https://daob.nl/files/S16-measurement-error-slides.pdf>

The exercises themselves can be found in the navigation bar to the left. At the moment, the only available exercises are those regarding *estimation* of measurement error: <https://daob.github.io/measurement-error/exercise-1.html>

The slides, current page, and the exercises were created by [me](https://daob.nl/about-me "A little more information about me (Daniel Oberski)").
